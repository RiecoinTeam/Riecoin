Riecoin Core
=============

Intro
-----
Riecoin is a decentralized and open source peer to peer digital currency, released in 2014. It is a fork of Bitcoin, also Proof of Work (PoW) based, and proposes similar features. However, its PoW is better, and this is what distiguishes Riecoin from similar currencies. Riecoin miners are not looking for useless hashes, but doing actual scientific number crunching.

Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run riecoin-qt.exe.

See the Riecoin.dev website for more information.
